# Causal-Inference



This repository includes the project our team performed for Causal Inference. Our dataset compared 2 marketing campaigns against a control group. We used a technique called "matching" to make sure that we were comparing people against those who were similar to them, and we also used a technique called "difference in difference" to evaluate how the campaigns differed after a surprise news story.
